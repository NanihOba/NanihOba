# Nation Building Services

This repository contains the source for a simple informational website that outlines consulting services for building and developing a nation. The page includes details about our mission, available services, an example of our founder's own nation-building project, tiered pricing with plan details, a new section explaining the department kits that come with each plan, a consultation call link, a short curriculum, and a media section where you can play, upload, and download example videos.

Open `website/index.html` in your browser to view the page locally.
